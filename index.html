            <h1>What Is Cybercrime?</h1>
            <div class="text-box">
            <p>Cybercrime is any criminal activity that involves a computer, networked device or a network.

                While most cybercrimes are carried out in order to generate profit for the cybercriminals, some cybercrimes are carried out against computers or devices directly to damage or disable them. Others use computers or networks to spread malware, illegal information, images or other materials. Some cybercrimes do both -- i.e., target computers to infect them with a computer virus, which is then spread to other machines and, sometimes, entire networks.</p>
